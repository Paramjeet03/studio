# **App Name**: LevelUp AI

## Core Features:

- Image Upload: File upload interface for submitting drawings or images.
- AI Level Generation: AI-powered level generation based on the uploaded image. The AI model will act as a tool to analyze the image and generate appropriate level layouts, objects, and themes.
- Theme Selection: Display several theme options derived using AI, such as 'Forest', 'Desert', 'Sci-Fi', etc., for the user to choose from to customize their level. These will act as parameters for the level generation tool.
- Level Preview: Display the generated level in a preview window, allowing users to see the generated level before exporting.
- Level Export: Option to export the generated level as a JSON file for use in game engines. This MVP will not directly integrate with any game engine, but will provide a compatible data format.
- Game Folder Interface: An interface for providing the game folder, which the tool uses to suggest appropriate scenes and create levels based on existing variables, functions, language, and engine.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray (#333) for a modern look.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#ddd) for backgrounds and subtle UI elements.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean and minimal layout with clear separation of sections.
- Use simple, geometric icons for a modern feel.
- Subtle transition animations for loading and theme selection.
